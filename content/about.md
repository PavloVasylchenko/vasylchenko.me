I am a Lead Software Developer with 16 years of experience in engineering.

I especially enjoy gaining new knowledge, setting goals, and overcoming challenges.

As an adherent of the Agile approach, I prefer to use the Scrum framework in project management.

I truly believe that every difficulty brings opportunities for growth.

In addition to my professional interests, I love traveling, meeting new people, sharing knowledge, listening to podcasts, and cycling.
