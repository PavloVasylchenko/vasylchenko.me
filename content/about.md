I am Team Lead / Engineering Manager with 15 years of experience in software engineering. 

Most of all I like to gain new knowledge, set goals and overcome challenges. 

Being an adherent of Agile approach, I prefer to use Scrum framework in project management. 

I truly believe that every difficulty brings opportunities for development. 

In addition to my professional interests, I love traveling, meeting new people, sharing knowledge, listening to podcasts and cycling.
